# VRP-routing
Efficient VRP Routing Using Modified Genetic Algorithm
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem
that focuses on determining the most efficient set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver
goods or services to a group of geographically dispersed customers, starting and ending at
one or more depots. Recognized as an NP-hard problem, VRP has been extensively studied
due to its practical relevance in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management.
Over time, the basic VRP model has evolved into numerous variants to reflect real-world
complexities, including constraints such as vehicle capacity, time windows for service,
multiple depots, dynamic customer demands, and heterogeneous vehicle fleets. These
extended versions, often referred to as rich VRPs, are designed to capture the intricacies of
modern transportation networks and provide more realistic solutions. The complexity of
VRP arises from the need to balance multiple competing objectives such as minimizing
total distance traveled, reducing operational costs, and ensuring timely service while
adhering to a range of logistical constraints, making it a cornerstone problem in the field of

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a powerful search and optimization method inspired by the
process of natural selection in biological evolution. It works by evolving a population of

potential solutions over successive generations, aiming to find the most optimal or near-
optimal solution to complex problems. Each individual in the population, called a

chromosome, represents a candidate solution, typically encoded as a binary string or a set
of parameters. These individuals are evaluated using a fitness function, which measures
how well they solve the problem. The fittest individuals are selected to reproduce, and their
genetic information is combined through crossover and slightly altered through mutation to
create a new generation. This process continues until a stopping criterion, such as a
maximum number of generations or a satisfactory fitness level, is met. GAs are widely used
in areas like machine learning, robotics, logistics, and artificial intelligence due to their
adaptability and ability to handle complex, non-linear, and multi-modal problems
effectively.
